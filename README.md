======

A Go AI running purley on clientside of the web with web workers.

## State
This works in its first iteration, however the web workers are not in yet and it still is pretty slow. And the UI isn't that beautiful. But you can play - jay!
However before a public release I'm still gonna get that done. So come back here!

## Running
You got to compile all the CoffeeScript and do it bare, for development you can do the following to auto compile changing files:

```bash
coffee -w -c --bare .
```

This should work with newer CoffeeScript versions.
